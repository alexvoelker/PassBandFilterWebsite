A website user interface to make working with a pass band filter website easier to do for everyday users.

### Running the website:
To run the website, you first need to install all the required dependencies.
To do so, run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` once you have navigated to the root folder of this directory.
Then, run the **`app.py`** file!

**Also, you will need to create a file called `flask_secret_key` and put some key in there!**
